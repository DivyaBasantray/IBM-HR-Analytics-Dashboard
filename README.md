# IBM HR Analytics Dashboard

## 🧠 **1. Project Objective**
- The goal of this project was to study employee attrition at IBM and find what factors make employees leave the company.  
- I used SQL, Python, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.  
- The final dashboard helps HR understand which groups of employees are at a higher risk of leaving and why.

## 📊 **2. Key Insights (from Power BI Dashboard)**
- Overall attrition rate is **16.1%** out of 1470 employees.  
- Employees who work **Over Time** have a much higher attrition rate than those who don’t.  
- Most employees who left had a **Monthly Income below 5K**.  
- **Sales Executives** and **Laboratory Technicians** show the highest attrition among all job roles.  
- Attrition is higher among employees aged **30–39** and those with **less than 3 years** at the company.
- Also mostly young aged employees shown higher attrition.
- Employees with **poor Work-Life Balance** or **frequent Over Time** are more likely to leave.

## ⚙️ **3. Tech Stack**
**SQL** – Used for initial data cleaning, removing duplicates, and fixing errors in columns.  
**Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Used for data exploration and adding new columns like `Attrition_num` for numeric analysis.  
**Power BI** – Used to create the final dashboard with KPIs, filters, and visuals to show trends and patterns in attrition data.

**Why these tools:**  
- SQL helped ensure clean, structured data.  
- Python made it easy to explore and understand relationships.  
- Power BI turned those findings into a clear, interactive story for business users.
